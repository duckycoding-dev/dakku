# Dakku - learn Japanese while having fun! ガーガー!

## The idea behind this webapp
Dakku is supposed to be a SRS system for helping Japanese learners practice words, kanjis and phrases

## The tech stack
This was also a way to experiment with new technologies and libraries
- Backend: HonoJS, hono-zod-openapi for creating well documented REST APIs, DrizzleORM and Zod for the backend
- Frontend: TanStack Query, Tanstack Router, React 19, Shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS
- Shared: Bun workspaces for managing the codespace as a monorepo, TypeScript, Eslint, Prettier

## Current state of the project
This is currently in idle, as I've decided to focus more on creating smaller / simpler projects in which I could leverage and learn the technologies themselves better, focusing less on the business logic of a complex application such as a SRS app with many possible features
